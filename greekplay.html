    <h1>Geethika presents a Greek play by Sophocles</h1>
    <h2>OEDIPUS AT COLONOS</h2>
    <h3>SOPHOCOLES</h3>
   
    <h5 class="name ANT">ANT.</h5>
    <p class="speech"> How dost thou know it? By what certain sign?</p>

   <h5 class="name OED">OED.</h5> 
   <p class="speech"> I know it perfectly. Let some one go
       With speed to bring the lord of Athens hither.</p>

<h5 class="name CHORUS">CHORUS.</h5>
<p class="speech">Great Heaven, how above me, beside me, around,                    
      Peals redoubled the soul-thrilling sound!
O our God, to this land, to our mother, if aught
Thou wouldst send with some darkness of destiny fraught,
Smile gently once more! With the good let me bear
      What of fortune soe'er,--
Taste no cup, touch no food, the doomed sinner may share.
      Zeus, to thee, Lord, I cry!</p>

<h5 class="name OED">OED.</h5> 
<p class="speech"> Is the King coming? Will he find me alive,
My daughters, and with reason undisturbed?</p>

<h5 class="name ANT">ANT.</h5>
<p class="speech"> Say wherefore dost thou crave with such desire
The clearness of an undistracted mind?</p>

<h5 class="name OED">OED.</h5>
<p class="speech"> I would fully render from a grateful soul
The boon I promised, when I gained my suit.</p>

<h5 class="name CHORUS">CHORUS</h5>
<p class="direction"> _(_looking towards Athens_)._</p>
<p class="speech">Come, my chief! come with speed! Or, if haply at hand,            
      On the height where the curved altars stand,
Thou art hallowing with oxen in sacrifice slain
Yonder shrine of Poseidon, dread lord of the main,
Hie thee hither! Be swift! The blind stranger intends
      To thee, to thy friends,
To thy city, for burdens imposed, just amends.
      Haste thee, King! Hear our cry!</p>

      <p class="direction">  _(_Enter_ THESEUS.)_</p>

<h5 class="name THE">THE.</h5>
<p class="speech"> Why sounds again from hence your joint appeal,
Wherein the stranger's voice is loudly heard?
Is it some lightning-bolt new-fallen from Zeus,
Or cloud-born hail that is come rattling down?
From Heavens so black with storm nought can surprise.</p>

<h5 class="name OED">OED.</h5>
<p class="speech"> Prince, thou art come to my desire. Some God
Hath happily directed this thy way.</p>
