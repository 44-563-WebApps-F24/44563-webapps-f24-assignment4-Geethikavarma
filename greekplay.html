        Oedipus had remained at Thebes for some time after his
        fall. But he was afterwards banished by the command
        of Creon, with the consent of his own sons. Their intention
        at first was to lay no claim to the throne. But by-and-by
        ambition prevailed with Eteocles, the younger-born, and
        he persuaded Creon and the citizens to banish his elder
        brother. Polynices took refuge at Argos, where he
        married the daughter of Adrastus, and levied an army of
        auxiliaries to support his pretensions to the throne of
        Thebes. Before going into exile Oedipus had cursed his
        sons.</p>
    <p>Antigone after a while fled forth to join her father and
        support him in his wanderings. Ismenè also once brought
        him secret intelligence.</p>
    <p>Years have now elapsed, and the Delphian oracle proclaims
        that if Oedipus dies in a foreign land the enemies of
        Thebes shall overcome her.</p>
    <p>In ignorance of this fact, Oedipus, now aged as well as
        blind, and led by his daughter Antigone, appears before
        the grove of the Eumenides, at Colonos, in the neighbourhood
        of Athens. He has felt an inward intimation, which
        is strengthened by some words of the oracle received by
        him long since at Delphi, that his involuntary crimes have
        been atoned for, and that the Avenging Deities will now
        receive him kindly and make his cause their own.</p>
    <p>After some natural hesitation on the part of the village-councillors
        of Colonos, Oedipus is received with princely
        magnanimity by Theseus, who takes him under the protection
        of Athens, and defends him against the machinations
        of Creon.</p>
    <p>Thus the blessing of the Gods, which Oedipus carried with
        him, is secured to Athens, and denied to Thebes. The
        craft of Creon and the prayers of Polynices alike prove
        unavailing. Then the man of many sorrows, whose
        essential nobleness has survived them all, passes away
        mysteriously from the sight of men.</p>
    <p>The scene is laid at Colonos, a suburb of Athens much
        frequented by the upper classes, especially the Knights
        (see Thuc. viii. 67); and before the sacred grove of the
        Eumenides, or Gentle Goddesses, a euphemistic title for the
        Erinyes, or Goddesses of Vengeance.</p>
